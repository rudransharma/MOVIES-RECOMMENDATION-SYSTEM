# MOVIES-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
Python College Project 
MOVIE Recommendation System with Python and Tkinter
~ Overview
This is a Python-based MOVIE Recommendation System built as a college project. The system combines web scraping techniques, data manipulation, and a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) created using the Tkinter library. It allows users to input their username and the name of an GENRE, and it provides them with a list of Movies by that GENRE based on a pre-loaded CSV dataset.


~ How It Works
- Users enter their username and the name of an GENRE in the provided fields.
- When the "Recommend MOVIES" button is clicked, the system checks the CSV dataset for MOVIES by the specified GENRE.
- If MOVIES by the GENRE are found, they are displayed to the user in a messagebox.
- If no MOVIES are found for the given GENRE, the system provides a message indicating so.

~Prerequisites
- To run this project, you need to have the following installed:
-  Python 3.x &  Tkinter (usually included with Python)
